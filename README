This is an implementation of Atari's Asteroids game from the 70's!
I made this in a university course a few years ago, in collaboration
with Devyn Stott.
Anyway, I figured Github would be a good place for me to put this so
I can keep track of it better. It was built on a RHEL machine, but it
runs on my Ubuntu 14.10 (and it ran on the earlier versions as well).
To get it running on Ubuntu, install freeglut3-dev, navigate to the
directory containing all the code, and type 'make'. This will make
an executable called 'a.out'. If you want it named something else,
just change up the makefile.

This was written by myself (Justin Ricks) and Devyn Stott, except for
the uiDraw.h, uiDraw.cpp, uiInteract.h, and uiInteract.cpp, which
were written by my Professor
